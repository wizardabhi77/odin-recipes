    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two cups of white sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness, while locking in the moisture from the other ingredients.</li>

        <li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>

        <li>All-purpose flour provides structure, acts as a thickening agent, and helps build the fluffy texture.</li>

        <li>Whole eggs affect the cake in a number of ways: They provide structure, add moisture, lend flavor, and contribute to a tender texture.</li>

        <li>Whole milk adds moisture and helps the batter come together smoothly.</li>

        <li>Two teaspoons of vanilla extract add complex flavor and bring out the flavors of the other ingredients, such as the cocoa powder.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the wet ingredients and beat with an electric mixer for about three minutes. Stir in the boiling water by hand</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into two prepared round cake pans. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool slightly before removing from the pans.

</li>
        <li>While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth and spreadable.

</li>
    </ol>
